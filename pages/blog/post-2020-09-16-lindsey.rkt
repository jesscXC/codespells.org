  @div{
    Lindsey sits down with Jay McCarthy of UMass Lowell to talk about what makes Racket such a great language for CodeSpells.

    @p{Stephen's already told us a little about why he chose Racket for this project, but I wanted to sit down with all-star Racketeer, Jay McCarthy, a professor at UMass Lowell, to talk about Racket and why it's so useful for our project. Jay has a long history with Racket and does a great job explaining what Racket's "secret sauce" is. Enjoy!}
