  "Builds released!"
  @div{
  There are three tech demos on the downloads page.
  }
  @md{
  An historic moment: early CodeSpells builds are @link-to-builds{available for download}.

  They are essentially tech demos at the moment.  And I wouldn't necessarily say that any of
  them are worth more than a few minutes of your time.  

  But still.  One small step for an indie game, one giant leap for mankind.  :)
