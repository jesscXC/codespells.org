  "Community Spotlight: Amulgagar"
  @div{
    I'm so excited to be getting to know some of our CodeSpells community members outside of Patreon & the Discord server - it's getting me hyped up about the CodeSpells relaunch!
  }
  @div{
    @p{A few days ago, I had the pleasure of meeting up with Amulgagar over Zoom! By day (and night), Amulgagar is a truck driver, so when he's chatting with us on Discord, he might be @b{anywhere} in the United States! Amulgagar has been with the CodeSpells community for a @b{long} time, so I was excited to learn about his experience with the project up to this point and his hopes for the future of the CodeSpells community:}
