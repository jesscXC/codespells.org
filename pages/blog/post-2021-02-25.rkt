Summary of Gameplay Proposals & Decisions:

  * Stephen: For the first game, a coinflip or dice roll will be used to determine who goes first. For future games, the loser of the last game will go first.
  * Lindsey: Today, we will use Woogachaka's d100 dice to determine who goes first (thanks for participating on the stream, Woogachaka!)  Stephen won the roll, meaning he plays first in the arena.
  * Stephen: Each player's first move must be to place their nexus (crystal).
  * Lindsey: Nexuses come into play with 100 mana "inside them".
  * Stephen: On each of our turns, we can propose a gameplay change, and then make a move in the game. On your move, you can also propose termination of gameplay.
    - Stephen placed his nexus on the main platform.
  * Lindsey: Nexuses cannot be attacked directly by a player.
    - Lindsey placed her nexus on the landing strip above the arena.
  * Stephen: Players can only utilize mana from their nexus within 2 player rolls' distance from the nexus (spherically).
  * Lindsey: Let's pause this game and develop some features that would help us continue the game tomorrow.
