    Lindsey seems to be winning
  }
  @md{

  It's hard to predict who will win a game that is being developed while we're playing it, but if we had to guess, Lindsey seems to have a slight edge.

  Lindsey has chosen to adopt a creature-focused strategy, whereas Stephen's strategy is more focused on control.

  Lindsey summoned a Sevarog and began advancing it toward Stephen's nexus.  Stephen's attempt to land a Parasite on Lindsey's Sevarog was successful -- but Lindsey managed to remove it with a Disenchant Spell.

  The current state of the game:

  * Stephen:
      - 1 Nexus (100 Mana)
      - 1 Pylon (+10 Mana per turn)

  * Lindsey:
      - 1 Nexus (0 Mana)
      - 1 Sevarog (100 Mana)

  Lindsey has more potential to do damage, but Stephen seems to
  have a structural advantage.

  In other news, we've been working on a
  Twitch bot, which lets you both add songs
  to a playlist that plays during our stream,
  and more importantly, lets you affect the
  state of the 3D world simply by typing
  commands in the [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codespells) chat.

  We'll be using this to give Twitch viewers
  more ways of interacting with our
  design stream over the coming weeks!

  A big thanks to everyone who has been
  showing up day after day to help us with
  this project!
