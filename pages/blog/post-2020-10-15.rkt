  "Fun with Physics"
  @div{
  This bug took me miles off-course.  Literally.
  }
  @div{
  @p{To make my rocks mod more fun, I've been working on a physics mod.}

  @p{Here, I cast a spell that simulates wind.  It not only moves the rocks, but also sends me
  flying for miles and miles, until I finally slam into a cliff.}
  
  @p{Not gonna lie: It was fun!}
