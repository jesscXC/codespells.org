  @div{
  Mods Rock!
  }
  @div{
  @p{Physical objects that react to each other and the environment are critical in almost any game.  In CodeSpells, rocks have served this purpose well.  In the original game, you could use Earth Magic to move rocks.  We even made a whole sport around this in our initial attempts at making a multi-player version.}

  @p{I'll be adding more rocks to this mod and releasing it soon.}
