  "Memes!"

  Fun with embedded browser.

  Lindsey and I have been working on spells that allow you to manipulate UI.
  We've successfully been able to create both traditional UI (like the spell editor)
  and "diagetic" UI (as shown in the video below)

  I have this dream of spawning a tower that shoots spells at my enemies,
  and I would have some UI at the base of the tower that lets me program
  what spell is being shot at any given time.

  But for now, we have memes!
